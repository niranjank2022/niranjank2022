# Hello! Welcome to my Profile

 I'm Niranjan ‚ò∫üñê.
 
 I am a Sophomore studying Computer Science Engineering at the College of Engineering, Guindy, Anna University. I know C, Python, Java, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I want to learn more and use them to bring about effective solutions for real-life problems.

 I'm a person who loves the process and the experience more than the result. Let's collaborate on awesome projects and if you want, follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/craziegeek). See you!
