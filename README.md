# Hello! Welcome to my Profile

 My name is Niranjan. I am doing my Bachelor of Engineering in CSE in College of Engineering, Guindy, Anna University. Yes, I'm a first year Computer Science student. I was not a kid who spent his time with a computer. But, I have been a kid of admiring logical reasoning. I loved solving Math problems and I still do. 

 I love learning new things and having a deep understanding on them. I'm a person who love the process and the experience more than the result. I lack aesthetic sense. I know C, C++, Python,
